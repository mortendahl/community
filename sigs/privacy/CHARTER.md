# SIG Privacy or SIG Security

## Objective

Privacy and security are becoming important aspects of machine learning, with maturing tools and techniques entering industry from academia.

This group facilitates discussion, cross-field collaboration, and concrete functionality in TensorFlow.

## Scope

The group is concerned with discussion and functionality fitting the following criteria:

- Applications of statistical and cryptographic privacy in machine learning
- Improving security properties of existing machine learning systems
- Improving accessibility of tools and techniques
- Useful for industrial and academic researchers in security & privacy
- High-level abstractions and APIs
- Conforms to established API patterns in TensorFlow
- Self-contained or proxy for external projects
- Follows code and documentation standards
- Not otherwise available in TensorFlow

## Membership

Anybody with an interest in helping bring security and privacy to TensorFlow is welcome to join the SIG. To participate, request an invitation to join the mailing list. Archives of the mailing list are publicly accessible.
